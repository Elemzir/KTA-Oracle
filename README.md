# KTA Oracle — The Most Capable Keeta Network Oracle

> **19 tools · 5 tiers · 0.4s finality · 100% on-chain · No API key**

Real-time KTA price intelligence, on-chain analytics, whale detection, compliance screening, wallet scoring, identity resolution, and the full Keeta Network SDK surface — served as a tiered REST API from Cloudflare's global edge. The only oracle that combines live price data, AI-powered market insights, and production Keeta SDK tooling in a single deployment.

**No API key. No email. No KYC. Your Keeta wallet address is the only identity.**

Payments are fully on-chain. Tier activation scans on-chain history in under 2 seconds. Every KTA sent from the same wallet accumulates — you're already on the ladder at 0.1 KTA.

## Subscription Tiers

Payments accumulate on-chain — multiple sends from the same wallet stack toward the highest tier.

| KTA sent | Tier | Tools | Oracle calls | Social alerts | Whale alerts | Duration |
|----------|------|-------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 0.1 | Free | 5 | 20 / day | 100 trial | 1 ever | 5 days |
| 10 | Starter | 8 | 60 total | Trial only | 3 / month | 30 days |
| 50 | Social | 8 | 150 / month | **Lifetime** | Unlimited | 30 days |
| 300 | Pro | 13 | 300 / month | **Lifetime** | Unlimited | 30 days |
| 600 | Business | 19 | Unlimited | **Lifetime** | Unlimited | 30 days |

Send KTA to the oracle wallet address (set in `wrangler.toml` as `ORACLE_WALLET` in KTA Social). Then call `POST /activate` with the sender wallet address. The oracle reads full on-chain history and assigns the correct tier immediately.

### Tier Progression

Each tier has a natural ceiling. Users typically upgrade when they hit one of these:

- **Free → Starter**: Free tier lasts 5 days. Whale feed is locked and only 1 whale alert ever fires. Sending 10 KTA total extends access to 30 days, unlocks the live whale feed on `/onboard`, adds 3 whale alerts/month, and triples the API quota. Already sent 0.1? Only 9.9 more needed — sends accumulate.
- **Starter → Social**: Starter alerts expire after 30 days and still count against the 100-alert trial cap. Social (50 KTA total) is where alerts become permanent — social platform alerts never expire even if Oracle access lapses. One on-chain send, lifetime delivery.
- **Social → Pro**: Users who need compliance tools, wallet scoring, transaction history, or on-chain analytics outgrow Social. Pro (300 KTA total) adds the full analytics suite — built for operators, teams, and builders.
- **Pro → Business**: Business (600 KTA total) removes all limits — all 19 SDK tools, unlimited API calls, priority processing. Designed for institutions and teams running automated KTA workflows.

**Accumulation is the key mechanic**: all sends from the same wallet stack toward the highest tier. A user who sent 0.1 KTA is already on the ladder — every subsequent send moves them up without starting over.

## Deploy

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler deploy
```

**Required secrets** — set before deploying:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put KEETA_SEED
npx wrangler secret put INTERNAL_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put KTA_SOCIAL_URL
```

`KEETA_SEED` is the BIP39 passphrase for the oracle wallet. `INTERNAL_SECRET` must match the value set in KTA Social. `KTA_SOCIAL_URL` is only required if not using the Cloudflare service binding (fallback HTTP).

`KEETA_ACCOUNT_INDEX` is set in `wrangler.toml` (non-secret, defaults to `0`).

## Performance

| Operation | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| API read (`/price`, `/rate`, `/whale/alerts`) | <5ms | Served from Cloudflare edge KV — no origin round-trip |
| Price freshness | 5 min max | Cron fires every 5 minutes, writes to KV |
| FX rate conversion | <1ms after first fetch | Rates cached in KV for 1 hour |
| KTA settlement | **0.4s** | Keeta Network native finality — faster than Solana (~400ms avg), Ethereum (~12s), Bitcoin (~10min) |
| Tier activation | ~1–2s total | 0.4s on-chain settlement + chain scan + KV write |
| Whale detection | every hour | Gated to hourly — avoids CPU overrun on the cron |

The cron runs all independent operations in parallel: price fetch, history read, and whale detection run concurrently, keeping each 5-minute cycle well within Cloudflare's 30-second CPU limit.

For a REST/JSON price oracle, sub-5ms edge reads from a globally distributed network is at the ceiling of what HTTP can deliver. There is no faster retrieval path short of embedding the data in a CDN response.

## Mobile

The Oracle landing page (`/`) is fully mobile-responsive — hamburger navigation, fluid layouts, and touch-optimised controls. Tested across viewport widths from 320px.

---

## Native SDK

All on-chain operations are performed natively through the Keeta Network SDK — no third-party APIs:

| Operation | Native method |
|-----------|---------------|
| Whale detection | `client.history()` + `effects.accounts` — reads chain directly |
| Tier activation | `scanChainTotal()` — sums KTA sent from subscriber wallet on-chain |
| FX quotes | `FX.Client.getEstimates()` — Keeta Anchor FX engine |
| Payment send | `UserClient` native transfer — 0.4s Keeta finality |
| Price (fallback) | `FX.Client.getEstimates()` KTA→USDC — Keeta liquidity pools |

The cron fetches live KTA price with a time-boxed 8s timeout and falls back to the last known price from KV — ensuring the cron never hangs regardless of network conditions. The Keeta Anchor SDK is used for on-demand price in HTTP endpoints where cold starts are acceptable.

---

## Stack

- Cloudflare Workers — TypeScript, cron trigger (`*/5 * * * *`)
- **Keeta Network SDK** — `@keetanetwork/keetanet-client`, `@keetanetwork/anchor` (100% native)
- Cloudflare KV — subscription state and price history ring buffer

## AI Integration

KTA Oracle exposes 19 SDK tools accessible through KTA Social at `/tools`. AI agents can connect via the REST endpoints or the SSE stream at `/stream?wallet=`. See the full integration guide at `/guide` on the KTA Social deployment.

### Agent quick-start

```
GET  https://kta.netrate.workers.dev/llms.txt        # full machine-readable spec
GET  https://kta.netrate.workers.dev/status?wallet=  # current tier + tools._unlock hint
GET  https://kta.netrate.workers.dev/stream?wallet=  # SSE live price feed
```

Every `/status` response includes a `tools._unlock` object showing: how many tools are available now, how many are locked, and exactly how much KTA is needed to unlock the next tier's tools. Agents can use this to autonomously discover upgrade paths.

### Tool tiers

| Tier | Tools | Adds |
|------|-------|------|
| Free (0.1 KTA) | 5 | `/price`, `/rate`, `/register`, `/status`, `/stream` |
| Starter (10 KTA) | 8 | `/whale/alerts`, AI insights, portfolio calc |
| Social (50 KTA) | 8 | Same endpoints + **lifetime** social alerts |
| Pro (300 KTA) | 13 | `/wallet/history`, `/wallet/score`, `/compliance/screen`, `/analytics/network`, `/network/health` |
| Business (600 KTA) | 19 | `/identity/resolve`, `/kyc/verify`, `/certificate/manage`, `/container/seal`, `/batch/build`, `/permissions/manage` |

---

## Alert detection tiers

The Oracle classifies every price move and emits a `changeLevel` to Social. Social uses this to bypass subscriber frequency timers on large moves.

| Price move | Level | Social cooldown override |
|---|---|---|
| < 5% | — | No alert emitted |
| 5–9% | `minor` | Respects subscriber frequency |
| 10–14% | `normal` | 4-hour max cooldown |
| 15–19% | `notable` | 1-hour max cooldown |
| 20–24% | `major` | 30-minute max cooldown |
| 25%+ | `extreme` | 5-minute max cooldown |

---

## Troubleshoot

**Every feature requires a minimum 0.1 KTA activated wallet.** Registration alone does not start alerts or unlock API access — you must send KTA and trigger activation.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Wallet shows `unregistered` after sending KTA | Activation not triggered | Call `POST /activate` (via Social's `/activate-oracle`) after sending KTA |
| No alerts despite being registered | Trial exhausted or wallet not activated | Check `GET /subscription?wallet=` — if `tier: unregistered`, activate first |
| Alerts stopped after some time | Oracle 30-day window expired | Social alerts survive if `socialLifetime: true` (50+ KTA sent). Renew Oracle by sending more KTA |
| Wrong currency in alerts | FX rate missed a cycle | Re-register with the correct currency. Rates update every cron cycle |
| `GET /rate` returns stale data | KV cache miss on cold start | The cron writes FX data every 5 minutes. Wait one cron cycle and retry |
| `KV put() limit exceeded` | Free plan KV write quota hit | Upgrade to Cloudflare Workers Paid ($5/mo) for 1M writes/month |
| Activation returns 0 KTA | Oracle wallet has no KTA balance | Oracle wallet needs KTA to call `getEstimates()` from Anchor FX |

**Check subscription status:**
```
GET /subscription?wallet=keeta_your_wallet
```
Returns `tier`, `amount`, `socialLifetime`, `expiresAt`, and `activatedAt`.

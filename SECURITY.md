## Architecture

### Secrets

All secrets (`KEETA_SEED`, `INTERNAL_SECRET`) are stored as encrypted Cloudflare Worker secrets set via `wrangler secret put`. They are never present in source code, `wrangler.toml`, logs, or any endpoint response.

### Oracle Wallet

The oracle wallet address is public by design — it receives KTA payments from subscribers. The `KEETA_SEED` (passphrase) that controls it is a Cloudflare secret and is never exposed.

### Internal Endpoints

`/fx/quote`, `/payment/send`, and `/verify-payment` require an `X-Internal-Secret` header. Requests without a valid secret receive a `401` immediately before any processing.

### Input Validation

All wallet addresses are validated against the `keeta_[a-z0-9]+` pattern before any on-chain or KV operation. Query parameters are type-checked and bounded before use.

### Transport

All traffic is served over HTTPS via Cloudflare's edge. No plain HTTP connections are accepted.

### Data Privacy

No personal data is stored. Wallet addresses are pseudonymous blockchain identifiers. No cookies, tracking, or analytics are used.

### Infrastructure

Deployed on Cloudflare Workers (serverless). The `workers_dev` subdomain is disabled — the worker is only accessible via service binding from KTA Social and scheduled cron triggers.
